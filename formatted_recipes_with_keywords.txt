<INGREDIENT_END> <STEP_START> Preheat oven to 325 F and prepare a cupcake pan with cupcake liners. <NEXT_STEP> Combine half of the sugar , flour and salt and sift them together through a fine mesh sieve 5 times. <NEXT_STEP> Set aside. <NEXT_STEP> Combine the egg whites, warm water, cream of tartar and vanilla extract and whip with a mixer on low speed until they get foamy. <NEXT_STEP> Increase speed to medium and continue whipping, adding remaining sugar 1 tablespoon at a time. <NEXT_STEP> Wait 5-10 seconds between each addition to give time for the sugar to incorporate. <NEXT_STEP> Increase to medium-high speed and whip until it reaches soft peaks. <NEXT_STEP> Using a rubber spatula, gently fold the flour mixture into the egg whites a couple tablespoons at a time. <NEXT_STEP> Sift the flour mixture again as you add it to the egg whites. <NEXT_STEP> Repeat until all the flour mixture has been added. <NEXT_STEP> It s important to add the flour mixture slowly to not deflate the egg whites. <NEXT_STEP> Spoon the batter into the cupcake liners and fill 3/4 full they should be pretty full. <NEXT_STEP> They rise better when more full. <NEXT_STEP> Bake the cupcakes until lightly browned, about 18-23 minutes. <NEXT_STEP> Remove cupcakes from the oven, then allow to cool completely on a wire rack. <NEXT_STEP> The cupcakes do fall a bit as they cool. <NEXT_STEP> Whip together your cream, sugar and vanilla on medium-high speed. <NEXT_STEP> This pace will make it easier to avoid over-whipping or under-whipping the frosting. <NEXT_STEP> Stop whipping as soon as the mixture becomes smooth and billowy. <NEXT_STEP> If you let the ingredients whip for too long, your frosting will curdle or take on a grainy texture. <NEXT_STEP> You want it to have a medium peak that forms when you lift up the whisk. <NEXT_STEP> Pipe or spread the frosting onto the cupcakes and top with your desired decoration. <STEP_END> <TITLE_START> Fluffy Angel Food Cupcakes <TITLE_END>

<NEXT_STEP> Add the milk and vanilla extract. <NEXT_STEP> Finally stir in the flour and mix well. <NEXT_STEP> Divide the mixture into equal portions add food colouring to each portion and mix well. <NEXT_STEP> Try using a plastic bag which saves washing up and helps with piping the batter into the cases. <NEXT_STEP> Cut the end of each piping bag creating a small hole. <NEXT_STEP> Pipe a thin layer of the first colour into all the cases smoothing down and spreading evenly with the back of a teaspoon. <NEXT_STEP> Repeat the process with the other colours in the order of blue green yellow and red until all the batter has been used. <NEXT_STEP> It is important not to fill the cupcake cases more than full as they will spill over when baked so try to keep each layer of batter thin. <NEXT_STEP> Bake for 20 25 minutes until brown and cooked throughout. <NEXT_STEP> Place on a cooling rack to cool completely. <NEXT_STEP> To make the buttercream whisk the butter sugar milk and vanilla extract together until light and fluffy. <NEXT_STEP> To make the pudsey bear decoration use a small palette knife to spread the buttercream lightly on top of each cupcake. <NEXT_STEP> Roll out the yellow sugar paste and using a circular pastry cutter cut out a circle slightly larger that your cupcake top to ensure that the cake is fully covered. <NEXT_STEP> Lay the sugar paste on top of the buttercream. <NEXT_STEP> Next cut out two smaller yellow circles for Pudsey s ears. <NEXT_STEP> You could use the base of a piping nozzle as a cutter. <NEXT_STEP> Attach these to the top of the cupcake by brushing the underside lightly with water. <NEXT_STEP> To give more definition to the ears push your finger into the centre of the sugar paste circles. <NEXT_STEP> Next roll out the white sugar paste and cut out a shape to act as Pudsey s eye patch. <NEXT_STEP> Attach this to the cupcake with water leaving room for the other facial features. <NEXT_STEP> Using the black sugar paste icing roll a small ball of icing between your fingers and attach to the cupcake for Pudsey s eye. <NEXT_STEP> Slightly press down to make the icing flatter and spread out then attach a much smaller ball of white icing to the top right corner of the eye. <NEXT_STEP> For the nose roll out a ball of black icing and attach to the centre of the cupcake slightly pressing down when attaching to flatten. <NEXT_STEP> For the eye brow and mouth simply roll a little sausage shape of black icing cutting to size if necessary and attach. <NEXT_STEP> To decorate Pudsey s eye patch cut out small circles of assorted coloured sugar paste and randomly attach the circles to your own style. <STEP_END> <TITLE_START> Pudsey Rainbow Cupcakes <TITLE_END> <RECIPE_END><RECIPE_START> <INPUT_START> almond

icing  <INGREDIENT_END> <STEP_START> Line two or three baking trays with greaseproof paper. <NEXT_STEP> Place all the ingredients in a bowl and mix with a spoon. <NEXT_STEP> Once blended use your hands to thoroughly knead the dough. <NEXT_STEP> Wrap the dough in cling film and leave in the fridge for 30 minutes. <NEXT_STEP> Preheat the oven to 170 C . <NEXT_STEP> To roll out the cookies sprinkle a little flour on your work surface and knead a little dough at a time leaving the rest in the fridge till you are ready to use it. <NEXT_STEP> When making iced biscuits its best to make them quite thick so that they can be handled easily. <NEXT_STEP> Cut out your desired shape place the cookie on a piece of baking parchment and then place the baking tray in the fridge. <NEXT_STEP> By cooling the tray and cookies they are less likely to spread when cooking and it prevents them from losing their shape. <NEXT_STEP> Bake your cookies in the oven for 10 12 minutes or until golden. <NEXT_STEP> Allow to cool before icing. <NEXT_STEP> When icing your cookies roll out sugar paste icing till it is really thin about 1 2mm thick. <NEXT_STEP> Then use the same cutter as you used for the cookie to cut out your shape in icing. <NEXT_STEP> Lift each piece of icing as you go so you can ensure that the edges are clean and sharp and there is no fraying which will look messy once it is on the biscuit. <NEXT_STEP> To get a sharp edge make sure that you have enough icing sugar under the icing when you roll it out to prevent the shape from sticking to the surface and when cutting out the shape move it around a little bit. <NEXT_STEP> If you need to remove any fray from the edges place the icing flat on your hand and with a soft bristled brush sweep the edges so the fray goes underneath. <NEXT_STEP> Do this lightly or you will make indents. <NEXT_STEP> When ready brush the back of the icing with water so that it becomes moist not wet then position on the biscuit. <NEXT_STEP> Use the palm of your hand to smooth the icing and leave to set/dry for a few hours. <NEXT_STEP> Repeat for each biscuit. <NEXT_STEP> For additional decoration make up a batch of royal icing which can be coloured with food colouring and pipe onto the biscuits. <STEP_END> <TITLE_START> Birthday Biscuits <TITLE_END> <RECIPE_END><RECIPE_START> <INPUT_START> buttercream <NEXT_INPUT>

<NEXT_INGREDIENT> 1 tbsp Cinnamon <NEXT_INGREDIENT> 2 tbsp Milk  <INGREDIENT_END> <STEP_START> Preheat your oven to 190 c/170 c fan/gas mark 5. <NEXT_STEP> Grease and line the bases of 3 20cm loose bottomed sandwich tins. <NEXT_STEP> Cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. <NEXT_STEP> Whisk in the eggs one at a time adding a tablespoon of flour with each one to stop the mixture curdling. <NEXT_STEP> Once the eggs have been added sift in the remaining flour baking powder and cinnamon. <NEXT_STEP> Tip in any bran left in the sieve. <NEXT_STEP> Gently fold in the flour and finally the milk until the batter has a soft dropping consistency. <NEXT_STEP> Divide the mixture evenly between the three tins and bake for 28 minutes. <NEXT_STEP> Check to see if the sponges spring back. <NEXT_STEP> They may need an additional 3 minutes and perhaps moving up in the oven if they have been baking on a lower shelf. <NEXT_STEP> When the sponges are cooked allow to cool in the tins for 5 minutes before turning out onto a rack to cool completely. <NEXT_STEP> To make the churros heat the oven to 200c/180fan/Gas6 and line 2 baking trays with parchment. <NEXT_STEP> Place the water butter and sugar into a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer. <NEXT_STEP> When the liquid is simmering remove from the heat and shoot in the flour. <NEXT_STEP> Beat vigorously until the mixture

Gradually beat this mixture into the flour mixture in the pan a quarter at a time. <NEXT_STEP> The mixture will seem slimy but when beaten vigorously it will become a stiff elastic paste. <NEXT_STEP> Prepare a piping bag with an open star nozzle and pipe 10cm lengths on the lined trays leaving space for them to expand. <NEXT_STEP> Bake for 18 minutes and then allow to dry out in the turned off

Use the pan to trace a heart onto a piece of parchment. <NEXT_STEP> Cut out the heart and line the bottom of the pan with it. <NEXT_STEP> Prepare one of the cake mixes according to the package instructions. <NEXT_STEP> Pour the cake batter into the prepared cake pan and bake according to the package instructions for a 9 by 13 inch pan or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out

cool then remove the cupcakes from the tins. <NEXT_STEP> Use any leftover batter to make more cupcakes. <NEXT_STEP> Melt the white chocolate in a double boiler. <NEXT_STEP> Set aside. <NEXT_STEP> Using a serrated knife slice off the domed top of the heart cake to create a flat even surface. <NEXT_STEP> You want the final height of the cake to be about 1 inch. <NEXT_STEP> Save any cake scraps to make cake pops. <NEXT_STEP> Place a 16 inch round cake board on top of the cake and flip upside down so the parchment paper is on top. <NEXT_STEP> Carefully remove the parchment paper and discard. <NEXT_STEP> Cut some strips of parchment paper and slide them under the cake a little bit to cover the cake board this will help keep the cake board clean when you frost the cakes. <NEXT_STEP> Set the

sprinkles and 4 with a pinch of chopped pistachios. <NEXT_STEP> Feel free to mix it up and do any combination of these decorations. <NEXT_STEP> Frost the entire cake with the red frosting. <NEXT_STEP> Remove the parchment paper strips and discard. <NEXT_STEP> Cut the icing sheet into 1 1/2 inch wide strips to go around the heart cake the strips should come up about 1/2 inch above the surface of the cake. <NEXT_STEP> You will need 4 strips to make it around the entire heart cake the fourth strip will need to be shorter so cut it to fit cleanly between the end of the first and third strips. <NEXT_STEP> Carefully press the icing strips around the cake to form the rim of the box. <NEXT_STEP> Arrange the cupcake candies inside the box on top of the cake. <NEXT_STEP> In a small pot bring the

temperature <NEXT_INGREDIENT> Red and blue food coloring <INGREDIENT_END> <STEP_START> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and lightly spray 2 standard cupcake tins. <NEXT_STEP> In an electric mixer on low speed combine the sugar and butter until well mixed. <NEXT_STEP> Turn the mixer up to medium high speed and beat until light and fluffy scraping down the sides of the bowl occasionally about 5 minutes. <NEXT_STEP> In a large bowl whisk together the baking powder salt flour cinnamon nutmeg and cloves. <NEXT_STEP> In a separate smaller bowl whisk together the vanilla extract and egg whites mixing well. <NEXT_STEP> Stir the pumpkin puree into the whites just until incorporated. <NEXT_STEP> In the bowl with the creamed butter and sugar add the flour and pumpkin mixtures about 1/3 at a time mixing until just incorporated ending with the pumpkin. <NEXT_STEP> Scrape down the bowl and beater and remove the beaters. <NEXT_STEP> With a rubber spatula fold the batter until it is one even color. <NEXT_STEP> Fold in the mini chocolate chips. <NEXT_STEP> Fill the prepared cupcake tin filling until the cups are almost full. <NEXT_STEP> Dip your fingers in a little bit of water and use it to pat down the mixture in each cup. <NEXT_STEP> Put the tin in the preheated oven and bake until a toothpick inserted comes out clean about 10 to 12 minutes. <NEXT_STEP> Transfer the tin to a wire rack and allow to cool to room temperature. <NEXT_STEP> Divide the buttercream. <NEXT_STEP> Leave the majority white for the base frosting and color approximately a quarter of the white in 3 portions with red blue and red and blue mixed together coloring to pipe the eyes. <NEXT_STEP> Unmold the cupcakes onto a work surface. <NEXT_STEP> Frost the cupcakes with the white buttercream and smooth it out with a knife or a small offset spatula. <NEXT_STEP> Fill 3 pastry bags with the blue buttercream and the black and red butter cream . <NEXT_STEP> Pipe on the iris of the eyes with blue buttercream. <NEXT_STEP> Pipe in the pupil with the black buttercream also add a couple of black lines to the iris as well. <NEXT_STEP> Pipe on veins using the red buttercream. <NEXT_STEP> Make sure to have a completely clean and dry bowl when you start your process any fat or liquid at all in the bowl will stunt the protein development of the albumen and you will not have a proper meringue at the end the results could be disastrous. <NEXT_STEP> Start whipping the egg whites slowly in the mixer by themselves until the whites are foamy. <NEXT_STEP> Increase the speed of the mixer and slowly start adding the sugar until all the sugar is incorporated. <NEXT_STEP> Once all the sugar is combined increase the speed of the mixer even further and whip until the mixture is shiny and stiff. <NEXT_STEP> You now have a meringue. <NEXT_STEP> You know when your meringue is done when you pull out the whip hold it horizontally and you have what looks a sparrow s beak on the end of the whip. <NEXT_STEP> Replace the whip turn the mixer on medium and start adding the butter a bit at a time once all the butter is incorporated turn the mixer on high and leave it for a while. <NEXT_STEP> Depending on the weather the buttercream could take anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes to form. <NEXT_STEP> You will know when it has formed when you hear the motor of the mixer starting to slow down and whine a little bit. <NEXT_STEP> Also when you first add the butter your meringue will break down and look nasty this is good and is what you want. <NEXT_STEP> When the buttercream is done the mixture will be homogeneous and consistent...and tasty. <NEXT_STEP> Remove the buttercream from the bowl and put in an airtight container. <NEXT_STEP> Buttercream can be kept at room temperature for a few days or in the refrigerator for 1 or 2 weeks but always use warm buttercream when icing a cake. <NEXT_STEP> To warm up the buttercream put it back in the mixer using the whip or the paddle and apply direct heat to the mixer bowl with a propane torch you can find at any hardware store. <NEXT_STEP> Food coloring method. <STEP_END> <TITLE_START> Eyeball Mini Cakes <TITLE_END>

<NEXT_STEP> Pour 2 tablespoons of the melted candy onto the center of a large serving platter or serving board . <NEXT_STEP> Place a 10 inch Styrofoam sphere on top of the candy and let set until hardened about 10 minutes. <NEXT_STEP> This will be the bottom round of the snowman. <NEXT_STEP> Trim 2 inches off the flat end of three 12 inch wooden skewers making sure that the skewers are even in length. <NEXT_STEP> Mark the center of the sphere and poke the 3 skewers bundled together into the center flat end first leaving about half the length of the skewers sticking out of the top. <NEXT_STEP> Align a 7 inch Styrofoam sphere on top and in the center of the 10 inch sphere and press down so the skewers are inserted into the smaller sphere securing the snowman head to the bottom. <NEXT_STEP> Leave a 1 inch gap between the 2 spheres. <NEXT_STEP> Set aside 5 cupcakes for making the nose later. <NEXT_STEP> Coat the bottom of 16 cupcakes with the melted candy and wedge them around the base of the bottom sphere so they are in contact with the board creating a ring of cupcakes to keep the base from moving. <NEXT_STEP> Poke a toothpick through the top center of each of the remaining cupcakes until the toothpick pokes out of the other side. <NEXT_STEP> Coat the bottom of one cupcake with some of the melted candy. <NEXT_STEP> Starting at the bottom of the snowman hold the top of the toothpick and poke the cupcake into the side of the sphere offset between the row of cupcakes below so that the toothpick is no longer showing and the coated bottom is pressed against the sphere. <NEXT_STEP> Working in batches so that the melted candy does not harden repeat with the remaining cupcakes until the bottom and head of the snowman are completely covered with cupcakes. <NEXT_STEP> To make the carrot nose Crumble the reserved 5 cupcakes into as fine a crumb as possible in a medium bowl. <NEXT_STEP> Add the vanilla frosting to the bowl and mix until well combined and the mixture can be formed into a stiff ball. <NEXT_STEP> Mold into a 4 inch carrot shape. <NEXT_STEP> Cut a 12 inch wooden skewer in half discard the half without the point. <NEXT_STEP> Insert the skewer half lengthwise through the center of the carrot with the pointed end sticking out of the flat side of the carrot. <NEXT_STEP> Freeze until solid about 30 minutes. <NEXT_STEP> Microwave the orange candy melting wafers in a medium microwave safe bowl in 30 second intervals stirring in between each until melted 1 to 2 minutes. <NEXT_STEP> Dip the frozen carrot into the orange candy until completely coated. <NEXT_STEP> Transfer to a parchment lined dish until hardened about 15 minutes. <NEXT_STEP> Attach the carrot nose to the center of the face with the pointed end of the skewer pressing in until the skewer is no longer visible and the carrot is straight. <NEXT_STEP> For the frosting Bring a few inches of water to a boil in a saucepan that can hold a heatproof stand mixer bowl above the water without the bottom of the bowl touching. <NEXT_STEP> Add the sugar lemon juice salt and egg whites to the mixer bowl and whisk together by hand. <NEXT_STEP> Set the bowl above the boiling water and whisk until the mixture is warm to the touch and the sugar is completely dissolved. <NEXT_STEP> Transfer to the stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and beat at medium high speed until the mixture is cool and holds stiff peaks 10 to 15 minutes. <NEXT_STEP> Transfer a quarter of the frosting to a large pastry bag fitted with a medium star tip. <NEXT_STEP> Pipe rosettes onto each cupcake starting in the center and swirling outwards until the entire cupcake is covered with frosting refilling the pastry bag with frosting as needed. <NEXT_STEP> To make the eyes and buttons Cut 3 toothpicks in half and discard one of the halves. <NEXT_STEP> Stick the pointed end of each remaining toothpick half into the back of a chocolate covered marshmallow cookie making sure it doesn t poke through the front. <NEXT_STEP> On the head where the eyes would be attach 2 marshmallow cookies to 2 cupcakes with the toothpicks. <NEXT_STEP> Attach 3 marshmallow cookies to 3 cupcakes down the front of the snowman where the buttons would be. <NEXT_STEP> To make the ear muffs Cut two 12 inch wooden skewers in half discard the ends without the point. <NEXT_STEP> Insert a skewer point side first into each side of the snowman head even with the eyes. <NEXT_STEP> Trim any excess skewer to leave 1 inch exposed. <NEXT_STEP> Attach a doughnut to each side of the head by pressing the doughnut into the skewer until it is flush with the head and pressing against the frosted cupcakes. <NEXT_STEP> Lay the two 9 inch sour candy strands next to each other across the top of the head to attach the ear muffs. <NEXT_STEP> Trim any excess if needed. <NEXT_STEP> To make the woven scarf Stack four 3 foot long sour candy strands on top of each other and position vertically in front of you. <NEXT_STEP> Measure 4 inches down from the top of the strands and insert a toothpick through all 4 pieces to attach them at the top. <NEXT_STEP> Separate the strands below the toothpick so they are no longer stacked on top of each other. <NEXT_STEP> Interlace the far right strand first under the strand next to it then over the strand next to that and finally under the last strand to create the first weave tightening as you go to create a snug pattern. <NEXT_STEP> Continue the pattern by bringing the same strand back over the strand closest to it then under the next strand and finally over the last strand on the far right. <NEXT_STEP> Repeat this pattern weaving side to side and back again until the strand has been completely woven through. <NEXT_STEP> Using a toothpick attach another 3 foot strand where the original one left off and continue until the new strand is woven through. <NEXT_STEP> Cut the remaining unwoven strands at the bottom. <NEXT_STEP> Use toothpicks to secure the scarf. <NEXT_STEP> Repeat this process starting with four new 3 foot sour candy strands and weaving in a fifth to create 2 woven scarf halves equal in length. <NEXT_STEP> Fray the unwoven section at the top of the scarf halves by pulling the different colors apart. <NEXT_STEP> Attach one of the scarf halves to the back of the snowman securing it with toothpicks. <NEXT_STEP> Wrap the scarf carefully around to the front of the snowman so the frayed end drapes near the buttons. <NEXT_STEP> Secure the other scarf half overlapping in the back if needed and wrap around to the front of the body so the ends of the scarves overlap. <NEXT_STEP> Keep chilled until serving. <NEXT_STEP> Serve within a day. <STEP_END> <TITLE_START> Gigantic Standing Snowman <TITLE_END>
